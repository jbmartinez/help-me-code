# Work in Progress

This is a proof of concept.

## Todo

Roughly in order of importance:

* Write tests
* Refactoring (the code is messy right now)
* Inject JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Angular, etc)
* Inject CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, Pure, etc)
* Better user interface:
  * Resize editors
  * Organize editors and preview in an arbitrary way
  * Full screen preview
